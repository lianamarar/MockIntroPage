      <h2>As a student and as an artist:</h2>
         <p>
            I was born in San Francisco and raised in San Diego, where I have developed a passion for the arts from a young age. I am a fourth year <i>Computer Science</i> Major at SDSU and I hope to interwine both my techincal skills as well as my creative skills; to further bridge the gap between <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, Math">STEM</abbr> and Art.

         <h2>Some of my favorite websites&colon;</h2>
          <p>A list of websites that I found to have beautiful UX/UI design. What design representations or styles I enjoy the most is minimalism with some modern edge or flair to the design. I typically enjoy a simple range of muted colors, juxtaposed with black and white. I am fond of websites that have a miminal flow to them, where text is not overcrowing, and images or widgets have subtle yet classic amimations to them.</p>
